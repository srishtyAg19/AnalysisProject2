### Recommendations

#### 1. Address Missing Data
- Use data imputation techniques or focus on subsets with complete data to enhance reliability.

#### 2. Focus on Low Happiness Regions
- Investigate countries with the lowest 'Life Ladder' scores to identify and address root causes of unhappiness.

#### 3. Explore Correlations
- Perform correlation analyses between 'Life Ladder' and other variables such as 'Log GDP per capita,' 'Social Support,' and 'Freedom to Make Life Choices' to identify key drivers of happiness.

#### 4. Policy Recommendations
- Promote policies that enhance social support systems and reduce corruption, as these strongly correlate with happiness.

#### 5. Longitudinal Studies
- Analyze trends over time to understand how socio-economic changes influence happiness.

#### 6. Visualizations
- Use scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to illustrate relationships between happiness and other variables.
